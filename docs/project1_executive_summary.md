# Project 1 — Sales KPI Dashboard (Executive Summary)

## Business Question
How are sales and profitability trending, and what are the biggest drivers by month, category, product, and region?

## Key Results
- Total Revenue: $10.26M
- Total Profit: $3.58M
- Profit Margin: 35%

## Insights
1) **Trend:** Revenue is (increasing/decreasing) over time; strongest month was June 2023 and weakest month was February 2024.
2) **Category:** Office Supplies drives the most revenue; Office Supplies drives the most profit; margin risk appears in Furniture.
3) **Products/Regions:** Top product is Furnishing 20069; top region is Northeast.

## Recommendations
1) **Protect margin:** Reduce discounting or adjust pricing in low-margin areas (category/segment) Furniture (and monitor high-volume Office Supplies promos), since these areas typically get margin squeezed—set a discount cap (e.g., >10% requires approval) and review profit-by-category monthly.
2) **Scale winners:** Focus inventory/marketing on top products Furnishings 20069, Tables 20056, and Paper 20106 and replicate tactics in region the Northeast.
3) **Improve performance:** Test promotions or channel shifts (Online/In-Store/Partner) to grow region the Southwest (lowest revenue region)—run a 4–6 week experiment comparing Online vs In-Store/Partner targeting, and shift budget to the channel that lifts revenue per order the most.
